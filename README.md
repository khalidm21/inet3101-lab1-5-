# Khalid Mohamed: Experimenting with Arrays, Dynamic Memory, and Linked Lists
**Inet 3101 Lab 1.5**

Followed Joe's example code and completed the instructions on what to modify.

1. The modified code in user-static arrays shows that C's compiler does not manage memory for you automatically, and data in neighboring structures can be overwritten.

2. The modified code in dynamically allocating memory brings forth a solution by managing memory dynamically with the `realloc` function. It also changes the size of the array in increments of 5 if it runs out of space. This was done through the program dynamically checking if the array was full and resizing when needed after the user inputs data with the `realloc` function.

These were the codes that were changed, but I also saw examples of LinkedLists, object-oriented programming, and how to manage allocation with structures.
